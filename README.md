# Extracting Modeled Surface Indicators from the DHS Program's API
## Purpose
This script allows the user to extract indicators from The DHS Program's API, specifically the 20 indicators for which the Program prepares [modeled surfaces](https://spatialdata.dhsprogram.com/modeled-surfaces/). When the script is run, it prompts the user to enter a survey ID, e.g., LB2019DHS for the 2019 Liberia DHS. The script then pulls the available indicators from the API and exports them into a single CSV.
